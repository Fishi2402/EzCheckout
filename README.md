# EzCheckout

**EzCheckout** is a simple application designed to provide an easy-to-use solution for small festivities with multiple checkout stations. The application offers a website that can be used both at individual checkout stations—each with its own set of items—and as a central dashboard to monitor the performance of all stations in real-time.

At a checkout station, EzCheckout does not replace a full-fledged POS system; rather, it serves as a supporting tool for the cashier. It helps organize orders efficiently, ensuring that users don’t have to manually keep track of multiple open orders when items are not immediately available. In addition to displaying the total amount for an order, the application keeps track of open orders, allowing cashiers to manage pending transactions more effectively.

Once an order is completed and the customer has received their items, it can simply be marked as closed.

## Analyitical possiblities

Since orders are tracked, EzCheckout provides valuable insights into sales trends. These analytics can be used to optimize organizational aspects for future festivities, helping to improve efficiency and resource planning.
